# Rust Plugins

This repo contains all of the Rust plugins I have developed. Some may rely on other plugins. These plugins are not up-to-date and may not work with the current version of Rust. Some, like the Leaderboard plugin, rely on a third-party service.

## BuffHorses

Finds horses and improves the stats to make them more usable.

## CheckForHeli

Checks if there is a Minicopter on the helipad for Small and Large Oil Rigs and messages the player if one is found.

## ChinookCrates

Automatically starts unlocking the crates that drop from Chinooks.

## Leaderboard

Listens to many events and sends them to the Danker Rust Server web app for processing.

## LimitTemp

Sets the minimum and maximum temperatures to be less annoying.

## LockProgression

Makes use of the Oxide permissions system to allow admins to lock and unlock certain features that would cause fast progression.

## MapTeleport

Fetches the location where a player has a map marker on and teleports them there. (I didn't know there was an in-game command for this before creating it :p)

## PvpAction

An improved version of my PvpAtNight plugin which communicates to the Danker Rust Server web app to track player's kills. This plugin improves the drop rates at night, gives rewards for PVP at night, and gives rewards to players at certain T2+ monuments. It also displays a UI element letting the player know that they are in a PVP area. There is also a Purge that randomly happens which allows for PVP.

## PvPAtNight

A less feature-rich version of PvpAction.

## SetDay

Allows admins to set the time to day.

## TrollSignal

Allows an admin to give themself a smoke grenade with a supply signal skin on it.

## Welcome

Welcomes users when they join the server.

## Wheel

Does nothing; was meant for testing.
